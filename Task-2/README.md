# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. The project utilizes both training and testing datasets to build and evaluate the performance of different classifiers.

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries were used in this project:

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing the model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning model building and evaluation, including:
  - `LogisticRegression`
  - `DecisionTreeClassifier`
  - `RandomForestClassifier`
  - `GridSearchCV`
  - `train_test_split`
  - `StandardScaler`
  - `LabelEncoder`
  - `Pipeline`
  - `classification_report`
  - `accuracy_score`

## Dataset

The datasets used in this project are:

- `fraudTrain.csv`: Training dataset
- `fraudTest.csv`: Testing dataset

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results

The performance of the models is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed classification reports for each model are provided in the notebook.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Different models are compared to identify the best performing one.
