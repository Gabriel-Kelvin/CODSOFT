# SPAM SMS Detection

This project aims to detect spam SMS messages using machine learning techniques. The following steps outline the process involved in building and evaluating the spam detection model.

## 1. Load the Dataset

The first step involves loading the dataset containing SMS messages labeled as either spam or ham (not spam).

## 2. Data Cleaning

In this step, the dataset is cleaned to remove any irrelevant information or inconsistencies that might affect the model's performance.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization

EDA is performed to understand the underlying patterns and distributions within the data. Various visualizations are created to aid in this understanding.

## 4. Preprocess the Data

Data preprocessing includes tasks such as tokenization, stop word removal, and other text normalization techniques to prepare the text data for feature extraction.

## 5. Feature Extraction using TF-IDF

Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is used to convert the text data into numerical features that can be used by the machine learning models.

## 6. Split the Data into Training and Test Sets

The dataset is split into training and test sets to evaluate the model's performance. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities.

## 7. Train and Evaluate Model

Various machine learning models are trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set to determine their effectiveness in detecting spam SMS messages.
